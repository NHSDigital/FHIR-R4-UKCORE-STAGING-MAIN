  <purpose value="The purpose of this profile is to hold information about a type of a manufactured item that is used in the provision of healthcare without being substantially changed through that activity. The device may be a medical or non-medical device. It is referenced by other resources for recording which device performed an action such as a procedure or an observation, referenced when prescribing and dispensing devices for patient use or for ordering supplies, and used to record and transmit Unique Device Identifier (UDI) information about a device such as a patient's implant." />

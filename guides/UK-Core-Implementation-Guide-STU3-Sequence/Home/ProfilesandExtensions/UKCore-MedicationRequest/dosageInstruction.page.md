## `dosageInstruction`

Consider aligning to the Implementation Guide for Digital Medicines, but as a minimum, `MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction.text`.

Where a structured dosage is provided, populate `MedicationRequest.dosageInstruction.text` with a human readable dosage string that is clinically equivalent to the coded dosage instruction. This is for interoperability with consuming systems that do not yet support fully structured dosing instructions.

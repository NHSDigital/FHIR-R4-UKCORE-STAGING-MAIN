## `recorder`

The identification of the `MedicationRequest.recorder` where this is a different person to the `MedicationRequest.requester` provides an additional point of contact for any queries related to the medication request and is done by a reference. 

Where possible, it is expected that the resource being referenced SHOULD conform to one of the following UK Core profiles:
- {{pagelink:UKCore-Practitioner}}
- {{pagelink:UKCore-PractitionerRole}}

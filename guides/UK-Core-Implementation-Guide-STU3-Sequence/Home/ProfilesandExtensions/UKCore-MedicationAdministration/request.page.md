## <code>{{page-title}}</code>

In many cases, a {{pagelink:Profile-MedicationRequest}} resource will exist and can be referenced. Consideration must be made when sharing the records to either also share the <code>MedicationRequest</code> or make it accessible by query, if/when required.  

Cases where a <code>MedicationRequest</code> may not exist include administration of medication bought over the counter or via an emergency supply of medication.

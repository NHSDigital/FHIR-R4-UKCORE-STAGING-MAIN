### Example Usage Scenarios ###
The following are example usage scenarios for the UK Core Observation profile:

- Query and retrieve a patient's laboratory observations
- Record or update a patient's laboratory observations

<br>
The Observation-Lab profile is for individual laboratory tests (Observation-Lab) which may form a larger set of tests, for example a urea and electrolyte test that contains many sub tests, or as a single test, for example Serum ferritin level.
<br><br>
The workflow below shows a possible way to group a set of related laboratory observations into the derived {{pagelink:UKCore-Observation-Group-Lab}}, which is then referenced within a diagnostic report. Seperate laboratory observations MAY be directly referenced within the diagnostic report.
<br>

<br><br>
Depending upon the countries or trusts workflow, an alternative is to have any separate laboratory observations referenced in a {{pagelink:UKCore-Observation-Group-Lab}} before being referenced in the diagnostic report. Although this creates extra resources it standardises the workflow.

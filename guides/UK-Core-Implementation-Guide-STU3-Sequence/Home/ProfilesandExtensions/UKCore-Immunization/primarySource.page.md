## `primarySource`

An indication that the content of the record is based on information from the person who administered the vaccine. This reflects the context under which the data was originally recorded.

Set as `true` when the content of the record is based on information from the person performing the vaccine or who has clinical responsibility for the vaccination, and the system can be considered a primary source of the vaccination event.
Set as `false` when the information has **not** come directly from people performing the vaccine (e.g. a patient or patientâ€™s carer), and the system should not be treated as a primary source for this record.
This is used to help identify and eliminate duplicate records held centrally.

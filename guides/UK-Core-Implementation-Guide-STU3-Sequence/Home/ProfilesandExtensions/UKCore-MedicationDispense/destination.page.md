## `destination`

If used, consider interpreting as the **Intended Destination** in the real world, this could change between being marked as "dispensed" and the patient receiving the medication.

For example, within an inpatient setting, the patient could have been transferred to a different ward before the dispensed medication is delivered.

Where possible, it is expected that the resource being referenced SHOULD conform to {{pagelink:Profile-Location}}

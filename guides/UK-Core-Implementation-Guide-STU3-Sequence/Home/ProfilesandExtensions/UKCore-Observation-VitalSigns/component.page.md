It is not expected that a Vital Signs observation, with the exception of Blood Pressure, will have the `Observation.component` element populated. Specific guidance around the slices for Systolic and Diastolic, and LOINC and SNOMED CT can be found on the {{pagelink:UKCore-Observation-VitalSigns-BloodPressure}} guidance, under {{pagelink:UKCore-Observation-VitalSigns-BloodPressure-Component}}.

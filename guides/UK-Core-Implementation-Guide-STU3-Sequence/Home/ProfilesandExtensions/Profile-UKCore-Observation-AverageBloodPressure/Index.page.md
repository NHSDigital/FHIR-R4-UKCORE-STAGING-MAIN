## Profile Specific Implementation Guidance: ##

This is a derived profile of {{pagelink:Profile-Observation,text:UKCore-Observation}} and this page only shows the differences between the two. Refer to the base Profile for more implementation guidance.

### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements

The following elements, in addition to those in the corresponding {{pagelink:Profile-Observation,text:UKCore-Observation}} parent profile, are identified as MustSupport, and it is expected that consumers and suppliers SHALL support these as per the {{pagelink:Guidance-MustSupport}}.

### Example Usage Scenarios ###
The following are example usage scenarios for the UK Core DiagnosticReport Lab profile:

- Query for a specific patient laboratory test result
- Query for recent laboratory test results
- Record or update a laboratory test result

Services that should consider using the  UK Core DiagnosticReport profile are:

- Lab Result



The DiagnosticReport-Lab profile is expected to reference either:
- a set of laboratory observations (Observation-Lab) that are grouped under one observation (Observation-LabGroup), for example a urea and electrolyte test that contains many sub tests,
- a single laboratory observation (Observation-Lab) that does not form part of a group of tests, for example Serum ferritin level,
- combinations of the above, for example a blood test may include multiple grouped tests such as Urea and electrolytes, Liver function tests, Full blood count, each having a single instance of Observation-LabGroup, along with single tests such as Serum C reactive protein level, eGFR using creatinine and Serum ferritin level, each having a single instance of Observation-Lab.

<br>
The workflow below shows a possible way to group a set of related laboratory observations into the derived {{pagelink:UKCore-Observation-Group-Lab}}, which is then referenced within a diagnostic report. Seperate laboratory observations MAY be directly referenced within the diagnostic report.

<br><br>
Depending upon the countries or trusts workflow, an alternative is to have any separate laboratory observations referenced in a {{pagelink:UKCore-Observation-Group-Lab}} before being referenced in the diagnostic report. Although this creates extra resources it standardises the workflow.

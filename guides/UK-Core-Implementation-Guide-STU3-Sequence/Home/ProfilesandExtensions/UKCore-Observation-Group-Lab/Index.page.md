### Example Usage Scenarios ###

The following are example usage scenarios for the UK Core Observation profile:

- Group specific laboratory observations together, for example Full Blood Count,
- Place laboratory observations in an ordered fashion.

<br>
The Observation-Group-Lab profile is used to reference multiple individual laboratory observations (Observation-Lab) which together form a larger test set.

The workflow below shows a possible way to group a set of related laboratory observations into the derived {{pagelink:Profile-Observation-Group-Lab}}, which is then referenced within a diagnostic report. Seperate laboratory observations MAY be directly referenced within the diagnostic report.
<br>

{{render: Derived-Profiles-Lab-Example }}
</div>

<br><br>
Depending upon the countries or trusts workflow, an alternative is to have any separate laboratory observations referenced in a {{pagelink:Profile-Observation-Group-Lab}} before being referenced in the diagnostic report. Although this creates extra resources it standardises the workflow.

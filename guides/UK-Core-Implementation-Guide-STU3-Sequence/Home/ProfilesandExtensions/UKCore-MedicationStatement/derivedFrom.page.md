## `derivedFrom`

Where a UK Core profile exists, the resource being referenced SHOULD conform to the profile.

This SHOULD be used only to reference information that can not be referenced by `MedicationStatement.basedOn`. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h4><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Important:</h4>
Population of both <code>MedicationStatement.derivedFrom</code> and <code>MedicationStatement.basedOn</code> SHOULD be avoided as potentially confusing. 
</div>

## `basedOn`

Where possible, it is expected that the resource being referenced SHOULD conform to one of the following UK Core profiles:

- [UKCore-CarePlan (draft)]("https://simplifier.net/guide/UKCoreImplementationGuideAssetsinDevelopment/Home/ProfilesandExtensions/Profile-UKCore-CarePlan)
- {{pagelink:Profile-MedicationRequest}}
- {{pagelink:Profile-ServiceRequest}}

If the clinical system has implemented the `CarePlan` resource, a logical link to the care plan for which the medication request is based has business benefit.

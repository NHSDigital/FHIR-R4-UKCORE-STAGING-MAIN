## `form`

Within the dm+d terminology, the Virtual Medicinal Product (VMP), Actual Medicinal Product (AMP), Virtual Medicinal Product Pack (VMPP) and Actual Medicinal Product Pack (AMPP) concepts include a coded form.

This element SHOULD be used where a medication is identified using a dm+d Virtual Therapeutic Moiety (VTM) concept and the prescriber wishes to qualify the VTM with a coded form.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h4><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Important</h4>
The NHS dm+d holds the coded <code>'&lt;DRUG_FORM&gt;'</code> attribute for a product within the Virtual Medicinal Product (VMP) concept class. It is held in the ‘VMP Form information’. Some current drug forms are not granular enough allowing for different intended uses. For example ‘capsule’ is attached to both oral capsule VMPs and vaginal capsule VMPs.
<br><br>The dm+d will revisit a number of drug forms and where appropriate include details of their release characteristics and intended route. These changes will allow dm+d to more closely align with European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM) dose forms and the modelling for dose forms in the International SNOMED CT data.

## Profiles and Extensions

## Extensions Index

This extension library contains all the extensions Clinically and Technically Assured for use with UK Core. The profiles are found in the {{pagelink:Library-Profiles}}. The table below lists all the current extensions and the context of use. 
<br><br>
The context of use column indicates the profile and /or element where the extension may be applied. The modifier extension column indicates whether the extension is a modifier extension or not.
<br><br>
The general rule is extensions can be ignored by receivers*. When a modifier extension is received it SHALL NOT be ignored as it modifies the meaning of the element or elements that contains it. Typically, this means information that qualifies or negates the primary meaning of the element that contains it.
